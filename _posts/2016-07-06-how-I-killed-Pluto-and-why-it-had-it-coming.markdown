I read this book during a short vacation in the beautiful Ardenne-area, Belgium. As it happens, exactly tens years after the demotion of Pluto from its planet to dwarf-planet status.

For me, the news of the demotion is a somewhat vague memory of the evening news. At the time I was clearly busy with other things and I never bothered to take the time to learn the fascination details of what was going on.

Oh Boy! Did this book made good on that!

The Solar System I grew up with had nine planets. Nicely ordered by the rhyme I learned at school. And if there ever was a Truth capitalized then _this_ was surely it. That I’m not alone in this view is confirmed by the many references and discussion regarding Pluto that happen surprisingly often even in my circle of non-astronomy-aficionados.

What I like about this book is that it replaced an anonymous fact with a deeper understanding of our neighborhood and an intuitive view _why_ Pluto is no longer part of the big-boys. Also, one thing that I had under-appreciated, is how long the search for planets has been going on, and -at the same time- not been going on.

The story begins with Dr. Brown’s time at Berkeley. Were the early-days of his planet-hunting career are remarkably close to even longer times ago.

It is the late 90s and the [Kuiper Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt) -a large disc of stuff beyond the planets- was just discovered. And by accident, Dr. Brown spends time at the Palomar Observatory.

There they have a 48-inch Schmidt Telescope which is a survey telescope, designed for scanning large areas of evening sky. This telescope becomes a vital tool in the years to come as it is perfect for treasure-seekers, exploring the far distance.

It is at this telescope where Dr. Brown also makes a bet with his friend Sabine; there _has_ to be a tenth planet somewhere at the edges of our Solar System, and he will be the one to find it before the end of 2004.

Sabine accepts the bet, only, there is a slight problem… nobody knows exactly what a planet is.

Around that time the telescope hadn’t been fitted with a digital camera yet. Images are captured on fourteen-inch-square pieces of glass covered in a photographic emulsion. With the help of a small -and dedicated!- team 15% of the night sky is captured over a period of two years in these plates. The final score, after many nights avoiding the moon, is 239 slates with fuzzy blobs and dots.

Once the plates are digitized, Dr. Brown writes a clever piece of software that scans for wandering stars. At the end of the scan, he finds 8,761 potential hits; a tiny speck jumping position between frames. These movement stand out against the stationary light of stars far away outside our Solar System.

With time -and even more patience- most of the potential hits are eliminated as false-positive. When the processing and reviewing are done the final score is down to: “no”: 8,734; “maybe,” 27; “Yes!” 0.

Dr. Brown writes; “It was hard not to feel distressed. What if there really _were_ no other planets out there? What if three years of photographing … came down to nothing at all.” Luckily for Dr. Brown there are things that compensate these marginal results because around that time he meets his future wife Diane and is rewarded tenure at Caltech.

Planet hunting is a tremendous undertaking given the mind-boggling size of even our close proximity. Compared to the ‘good-old-days’ it is, however, hard to overstate what a positive impact computerized processing and digital cameras have made on the field.

Just a few years later, in 2002, a digital camera is mounted on the same Palomar Observatory survey telescope. With this new equipment the team is able to scan a large portion of the sky in a fraction of the time. They can see fainter objects quicker and -not the be downplayed-; “you needn’t even be awake for the results to come in!”

A few months into the new project Dr. Brown’s graduate student Chad Trujillo is discovering objects beyond Neptune at a steady rate.

### Pluto
From the start, Pluto -discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh- was the odd one out. Weighing in at half the size of Earth’s moon -it was so tiny that astronomers first reasoned that it must therefor be _extremely_ heavy- and orbiting at a twenty degree angle from all the other planets, astronomers had a hard time figuring out what it was.

Since there was nothing else known orbiting out there, and there was no other classification then _planet_, astronomers had no choice other then to mark Pluto as number nine from the Sun.

In 2005 Dr. Brown and his team finally discover what they set out to find: an object more massive than Pluto! They name it [Eris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)). She is the goddess of strife and discord, and probably for that reason, one of the few names left allowed for this kind of find.

NASA initially declared this find as the Solar System’s tenth planet, but with time Eris becomes the final blow for Pluto.

With this find and the prospect that other similar sized objects might be discovered in the future, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally defines the term _planet_ for the first time in 2006. Overnight planets went from colloquial "wandering stars” to objects that have to meet a formal set of requirements. And under these new terms, Pluto, Ceres, Haumea and Makemake didn’t make it.

Pluto is still there and these discussions come with the knowledge that a definition is just a line in the sand, drawn by humans. After reading Dr. Brown's book and looking at pictures like the one below, it makes sense that we draw the line at its current position.

Who knows what else is out there. Finds like [Sedna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna) -a minor planet also discovered by Dr. Brown- might reopen the definition discussion in the future. But for now, Dr. Brown suggests, “there is so much we don’t know, that we should focus out attention on what the Solar System means rather then what makes a planet.”  

Dr. Brown did win his bet with Sabine after she was kind to give him a 5 day extension, purely on the basis how _they_ had agreed to define a planet.

## Final remarks
If there is one central theme in this book, it is that this line of work requires an enormous amount of dedication and _love for the sea_. Technology has changed the game but there are still many sleepless nights staring at computer screens, turning dials and years of shifting through piles of raw data with fuzzy dots.

The book reads like a good _whodunnit_ and it is filled with clever tricks, leaps of ingenuity and personal wrinkles showing that competition at the frontier of science is a tough game. Finding a planet is a truly a life-project and we can be grateful there are people who extend our knowledge one small step at a time.

In 2015 we saw jaw-dropping pictures of Pluto arriving from the _New Horizons_ spacecraft. Pictures forever transforming the blob at the edge of our Solar System to a majestic place with a rich history.

Images like these make the stories of family and life in this book come to life, together they give an extraordinary look into modern day astronomy.

Highly recommended.

## Video time
For those who can't get enough of Dr. Brown, here is a recording of a talk on the same subject.

{% include youtube.html id="7pbj_llmiMg" %}

It was recorded for the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures. They host a great collection of related subjects on their [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SVAstronomyLectures/videos).

But before you get lost there: go and read that book!
