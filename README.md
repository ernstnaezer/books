# The Reading List

## a history of books, thoughts and notes.
This is my personal space to keep track of the books I've read an the remarks, thoughts and comments on them.

You're looking at the source code for the site, for the live version please go [here](http://www.ernstnaezer.nl)

The theme for this site is based on [blackrockdigital](http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/)

## Building from source
If you want to host your own copy of the site -which is of course highly encouraged- then perform the following steps;

1. `git clone https://github.com/ernstnaezer/books.git`
2. `cd books`
3. `npm install` && `gem install bundler`
4. `node_modules/.bin/grunt`
5. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. open `http://localhost:4000`

You can also run `node_modules/.bin/grunt watch` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` each in a separate terminal. This rebuilds the CSS and website on-the-fly; handy for a short dev-cycle.
