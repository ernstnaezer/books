  <h3>Hi!</h3>
  <p class="lead">This is my personal space to keep track of the books I've read and the remarks, thoughts and comments on them.</p>
  <p>I am a technology creator and thinker who loves working with the odd ones out. I have a wide range of work experiences; from building software for embedded devices -yes before it was called Internet of Things- to designing and operating web applications at scale. </p>

  The common thread in my work is that <i>things</i> should be relevant and meaningful for humans. </p>

  <p>The book I read are mostly about design, philosophy, physics, critical thinking and mental models, biology, neurology, economics, society and science history in general. As you might have guessed most of them are non-fiction with the exception of a few that are simply too good to skip.</a>

  <p>If you want to get in touch with me - with a book sugestion? - then please drop me a message via one of the channels linked to the bottom of this site.</p>

  <p>The pictures where taken many years ago during a period where I spend an substancial amount of of time wondering through old, forgotten and abandoned buildings with a good friend of mine. You can view more of them <a href="http://www.urbanexplorers.nl">here</a>

  <p>Regards and keep your #ThinkingCritical</p>
